***TO DO***

index.html--add mouseover, mouseup, mousedown, mouseout event listeners to links in 
navbar--mirror the buttons below.
  Hide textboxes by default and only reveal 1 (if internet detected) or none (if no internet)
  Create a "submitted" notification after clicking submit

readsubmissions--Hide textboxes by default and only reveal 1 (if internet detected) or none (if no internet)

Buttons--use an "initializeButton" function to fine-tune when buttons listeners are tied?
initializeButton can also be used to unhide the buttons--they can be hidden by default.

pomodoro--add a lofi listening section.
  This site will allow me to have the virtual cottage experience anywhere, not just on a computer with steam and the game downloaded--making
  a great study aid more flexible in its availability, so i can pomodoro wherever.
  implement EASY PIE CHART on the timer page

***Done***

buttons.js--add common button listenerevents to this (the "UX" parts), so that 
they can be applied to all html pages regardless of 
whatever other functionality is needed. Keep button-specific listener events (onClick) in the
individual js docs.

index.js--Left and right keyboard arrow keys still work on No Internet Page--disable them.--
  -->created initArrowKeys function in buttons.js to handle this. Now, only tie arrow keys
  when I specifically call the function
